# SVM-Baybayin-Word-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of SVM to detect Baybayin words, for a thesis which aimed at preserving and promoting the ancient Filipino script, Baybayin. The project leverages machine learning, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to detect and classify Baybayin characters and words from handwritten or digital inputs.
